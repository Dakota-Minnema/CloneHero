loading_phrase = <i>Griftwood</i> was written specifically about ex-Vice President and homophobic villain of the week on The CW, Mike Pence. According to Tobias Forge, "That songâ€™s about him and anyone like him who's willing to soil everything they've worked for. They definitely qualify for a front-row ticket to Hell. Which is so ironic, because that's what they believe in".
