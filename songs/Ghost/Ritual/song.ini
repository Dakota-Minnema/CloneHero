loading_phrase = “Ritual” establishes Ghost as more than a simple metal band; it sets them as agents of Satan, sent to Earth to perform a ritual and worship the devil. Off their first album, this song has become a favorite amongst fans and it partly narrates Satan’s story as well as sets the procedure of the dark ritual.
