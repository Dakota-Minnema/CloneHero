loading_phrase = “Dance Macabre” talks about the Black Death, and how the pandemic killed thousands of people in a matter of days. The presence of death in every corner left everyone living like there’s no tomorrow; Europe was in a macabre dance. The song title is a reference to Camille Saint-Saëns “Danse macabre,” a tone poem for orchestra, that has the presence of the tritone, which was known as the Devil in music during the Medieval eras.
