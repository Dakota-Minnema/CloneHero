loading_phrase = <i>Hunter's Moon</i> was originally released in 2021 as a promotional single for the film <i>Halloween Kills</i>. When asked about how he came up with the song, frontman Tobias Forge claimed it was inspired after researching different phases of the moon after hearing the Neil Young album, <i>Harvest Moon</i>: "Immediately upon seeing [Hunter's Moon], I thought that, well, if I were to ever write a song about Halloween, as you must do as a gothic rock band, I'm gonna use that title".
