loading_phrase = In the title of the song and the album's cover art, "One-X" resembles a person who doesn't fit in society or the crowd that he is in. It's about feeling different or singled out feeling like you're alone with no one understanding you or caring about you. Almost like you've been marked with an X (a bulls eye).
