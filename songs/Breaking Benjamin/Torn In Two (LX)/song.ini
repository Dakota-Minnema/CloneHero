loading_phrase = This song further describes the journey of a father whose daughter had been kidnapped and murdered. Picking up right after Red Cold River, Torn in Two shows the now-deformed father in what appears to be Hell, trying to find his missing daughter. As he searches, he makes discoveries that would be deemed deeply disturbing to most; a woman who appears to be like a demon and a man that could be depicted as the Devil himself. As the song closes out, the father finds his daughter once more, but again the two are separated, this time possibly forever.
