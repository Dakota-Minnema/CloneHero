loading_phrase = “Sleeptalk” is about lead singer Rory Rodriguez and his ex-girlfriend. For three years <i>after</i> they had broken up, they continued sleeping together, even going on dates. They were free to see other people, yet he felt guilty when he did, plagued by a fear of saying someone else’s name under his breath while sleeping with his ex-girlfriend – “sleeptalk”.
