loading_phrase = While speaking about this song, Volbeat guitarist Rob Caggiano told Metal Hammer: "This is a cover song. It's originally by a band called Teenage Bottlerocket, who are also good friends of ours. They very much have the spirit of the Ramones in their music. 'Rebound' is a song that we all love, the lyrics are great and it's really catchy. We got the news while we were in the studio that their drummer had died. So we learnt the song and recorded it as a tribute to them." RIP Brandon Carlisle
