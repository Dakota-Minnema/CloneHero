loading_phrase = Lyrically, the song is about a dying person in the last stage of a severe illness. The lyrical "I" has come to accept that they are going to die and begs their doctor for a shot of Brompton Cocktail, which is an elixir meant for use as a pain suppressant for terminally-ill patients to maintain sociability near death. They know they are dying and want to leave pain-free and feeling alive.
