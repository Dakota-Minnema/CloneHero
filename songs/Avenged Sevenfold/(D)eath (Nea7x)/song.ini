loading_phrase = A journey of a person who believes "life is but a dream." He ends up killing himself by jumping off a building. He feels justified in his actions, even euphoric, because he thinks he is dreaming, therefore it doesn't matter. An orchestra ensemble grows louder and more sinister as the song ends, signifying the abrupt end of his life.
