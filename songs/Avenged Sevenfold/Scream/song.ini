loading_phrase = This song could be about two things. For one, it could be about M. Shadows distaste with the fact that it is frowned upon to give into your lust and sexual instinct as a human. Another possibility is that he is critiquing that fact that so many would give into their based animal desires. Whichever the reasoning for the song it is still a catchy song.
