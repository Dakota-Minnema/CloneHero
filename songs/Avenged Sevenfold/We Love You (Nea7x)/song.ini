loading_phrase = Set to a 4/4 techno beat, the song is a "cross between Mr. Bungle and R. Kelly", says Brooks. Shadows came up with the chant in the shower: "I was like, "More sex, more pills, more drugs, more, more." It's everything. Those are the simple little things that are like the "A-ha!" moments."
