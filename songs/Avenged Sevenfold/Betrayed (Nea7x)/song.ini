loading_phrase = This song is a tribute to "Dimebag" Darrell Abbott, who was the guitarist for the heavy metal band Pantera, one of Avenged Sevenfold's biggest influences. The man in the song (a deranged fan of Dimebag) blames him for breaking up the band and kills him on stage while performing with another band. The song is written from the perspective of 3 different people: M. Shadows, Dimebag, and the murderer.
