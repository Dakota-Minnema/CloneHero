loading_phrase = The narrator sings about growing up broke and living off the street, more of a metaphor, not saying he was homeless, but more the fact that he grew up learning stuff off the street. He would of been taught about gangs, who and who not to mess with. It sings of racism and the murders between gangs because of different races.
