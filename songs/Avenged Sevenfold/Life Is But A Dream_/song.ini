loading_phrase = Originally called "Il sogno del fiume" (translation: River's Dream), this instrumental by Syn was written for Shadows' firstborn son, River, 10 years ago. "I spent the last two years of my life learning how to play that song. And it was the craziest undertaking I've ever experienced," says Syn. Zacky calls it "a sombre and uplifting ending to a very cathartic album".
