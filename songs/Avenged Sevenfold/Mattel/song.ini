loading_phrase = With tough guitars balanced with jazzier effervescence, M. Shadows sings of living in an artificial world while searching for meaning. "Are videogames getting too close to real life? Or is real life emulating the games? It's getting very hard to tell," Shadows says. Adds Zacky: "I love the barrage of noise in the solo. It takes your mind for a complete spin."
