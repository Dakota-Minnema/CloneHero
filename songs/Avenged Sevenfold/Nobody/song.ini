loading_phrase = The lead-off single combines strings, blasts of guitar noise, jazz, vocal harmonies and an elegant rock solo into an unpredictable whole. Explains Brooks: "You can probably hear some jazz fusion influence between Synyster Gates and I as we take off." Adds bassist Johnny Christ: "We kicked around the idea of it sounding like it got inspiration from Terminator 2; it sounded like the metal becoming liquid."
