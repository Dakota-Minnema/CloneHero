loading_phrase = "Fiction" was the final song written and recorded by original drummer Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan. The song was originally recorded on an organ. Sullivan gave the piece to lead singer M. Shadows, and three days later, he committed suicide in his apartment. In an autopsy, the cops ruled out fowl-play. Shadows later went back in to add revisions and the song was completed, featuring both his and Sullivan's vocals.
