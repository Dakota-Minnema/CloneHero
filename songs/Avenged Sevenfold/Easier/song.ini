loading_phrase = Originally an insecure love song written many years ago by Synyster: "I would sing it to The Rev and he'd just fucking crack up." Musical influences are Kanye, Stevie Wonder, Led Zeppelin drums and Faith No More. "It's jazzy, it's funky, it's progressive," says Zacky, with new "witty lyrics that tie into this story of man and mankind and how highly we think of ourselves".
