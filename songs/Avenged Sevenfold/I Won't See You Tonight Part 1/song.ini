loading_phrase = This song is in perspective of Justin Sane. The band member, Synyster Gates, walked in on Justin Sane attempting to commit suicide, by drinking tons of cough medicine. Justin Sane was bipolar, and was immediately sent in to a mental hospital. Upon returning, the band members explained "It seemed like he was always on acid" so they had to let him go. This is from the perspective of when he was suicidal, and it is an extremely emotional, and amazing song.
