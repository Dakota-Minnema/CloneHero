loading_phrase = <br>An earlier version of the track was played on Skrillex’s BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix, in June 2013, and became quite popular for being an unusual sound for him. Such popularity also caught the attention of dubstep producers, who tried to reproduce its flow: A heavy, glitched one-note bassline, with samples throughout. The most notable example being Zomboy (Joshua Mellody)’s track “Terror Squad,” released december of the same year.<br><br>At the time, “All is Fair in Love and Brostep” was still known as “Untitled DJ Tool/This Much Power” by the fans, with no sign of a release date, and few people took notice of the similarities between both songs. Fast forward four months later – With the release of Recess – and Zomboy’s track “Terror Squad” immediately got bashed throughout the internet as a “blatant rip-off”.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><color=#070C10>- Track 1 from "Recess" -
