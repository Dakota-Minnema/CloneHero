loading_phrase = <br>The long awaited genre-masher from the biggest name in dubstep, Skrillex, and up-and-coming MC Chance The Rapper, “Coast Is Clear” is taken from Skrill’s debut album Recess (2014). Oddly, Skrillex had built a career on EPs up until this point, so the album release is something of a career milestone.<br><br><i>"I thought this song was gonna be called “The Questions” when we first started, hence all the interrogative sentences in the hook. I thought it was clever, but Sonny likes the “coast is clear” line a lot I guess."</i><br>- Chance The Rapper (Genius)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><color=#070C10>- Track 5 from "Recess" -
